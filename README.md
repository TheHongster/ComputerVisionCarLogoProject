# ITCS-4152 Computer Vision Course Project
This was a course project I worked on with 4 others for UNCC ITCS-4152 Computer Vision. 
Weights and coordinates for bounding boxes were obtained by using the tools YOLOv3 and YOLO-label:

We used 5 car logos, (Toyota, Honda, Audi, Lexus, and Mercedes), for our detection weights with 200 images per logo as a training dataset scraped from Google image searching.
## Usage
To properly run the car logo detection, you will need Google Colab to view the .ipynb file alongside and Google Drive account to properly arrange the directories as specified in the readme section within the Stage 4 .ipynb file:
